# SdGraphics

SdGraphics is a Windows program that reads text files from the output of
<a href="http://www.lynette.org/sd/download-pc.html">Sd</a>
and transforms the formations to easy-to-read graphic images.

The program is probably most useful for single dancers attending 2-couples Virtual Squareddances (VSD).
With the output from the program you can go through a tip at your own pace, pause whenever you like,
possibly check the call definition, and try to figure out how to reach the ending formation of each call.

SdGraphics requires a <a href="http://www.lynette.org/sd/download-pc.html">Sd</a> file as input,
so it requires knowledge of how to use the Sd program.
If you are not a caller, you have to create the Sd file while listening to a recorded dance.
Some callers allow you to download the sound recording from dances you attend for free.
You can also buy recordings for a  small fee from 
<a href="https://www.krubow.com/Recordings/Recordings.html">Keith Rubows recordings page</a>.

The program creates a PDF file with all calls and resulting formations.
If you want to distribute this file to others, it is of course important taht you ask the caller’s permission,
and add the name of the caller to the copyright notice printed on each page.
The PDF file can be printed, or you might want to downloaded to a smartphone.

SdGraphics can also create a “zipped” (compressed) file with pictures of all formations and corresponding calls.
These pictures can then be displayed one at a time, in a browser on your desktop or in a smartphone,
using an html file (ZipViewer.html) delivered with the application.
One click, and the call is displayed. Another click, and the resulting formation is displayed. 
ZipViewer currently has some problems diplaying large dancer matrixes.

The program can rotate all formations in a way that one selected dancer is shown with his/hers nose “up”.
This option makes it easier for single dancers to check that they are standing in the right position.

This application still has some minor flaws, and more functionality can be added.
