# SdGraphics
SdGraphics is a Windows program that reads text files from the output of
<a href="http://www.lynette.org/sd/download-pc.html">Sd</a>,
which is "a square dance caller's helper", and produces a PDF file with pictures of the dancer
formations after each call. The program can also produce a zip file with all formation pictures (jpg).
This zip file can be read by an included html file where the pictures and corresponding calls can be
displaye one by one.
