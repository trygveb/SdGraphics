# SdGraphics
SdGraphics is a Windows program that reads text files from the output of
<a href="http://www.lynette.org/sd/download-pc.html">Sd</a>,
which is "a square dance caller's helper", and produces a PDF file with pictures of the dancer
formations after each call.
The program can also produce a zip file with all formation pictures (jpg).
This zip file can be read by an included html file (Web/ZipViewer.html) where the pictures and corresponding calls can be
displayed one by one. One click, and the call is displayed. Another click, and the resulting formation is displayed. 
This makes it very easy to go through the tip (without music) at your own pace, using a browser in your handheld smartphone.
If you are a single dancer, you can let SdGraphics rotate all formations in a way that one selected dancer always has it's nose up.
